# Guide-to-Change-Proxy-to-USA
 By understanding the different types of USA proxies and how to change your proxy to the USA, you can make informed decisions and enjoy a safer, more unrestricted online experience.

## What is a USA Proxy Server?
A [USA proxy server](https://www.okeyproxy.com/en/residential-proxies) acts as an intermediary server situated in the United States, routing your internet traffic through it. By doing so, it masks your original IP address with an American one. This process offers multiple advantages, such as enhanced privacy, improved security, and access to content that is specific to the USA region.

## How to Change Proxy to USA?

Switching your proxy to a USA-based one can help you access region-specific content, enhance your privacy, and improve your internet experience. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you change your proxy to a USA-based server:

### 1. Choose a Proxy Service
